## ðŸ§  Overview

The **Vestigial Port Model (VPM)** proposes that the pineal gland is an evolutionary interface â€” a "vestigial port" â€” connecting human consciousness to an external, non-local base reality.  

This model challenges the idea that consciousness arises solely from brain matter. Instead, it suggests a layered simulation-like architecture, where consciousness can access deeper dimensions through resonance, endogenous DMT, and entrainment.
