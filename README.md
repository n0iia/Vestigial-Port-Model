# The Vestigial Port Model (VPM)

*Published April 12, 2025*

## Abstract
The Vestigial Port Model (VPM) proposes that the pineal gland serves as a biological interface connecting human consciousness to a base, non-local reality. This theory incorporates neuroscience, quantum frameworks, and ancient metaphysical insight, suggesting that consciousness is externally sourced and transduced biologically. The Dimensional Memory Protocol (DMP) is introduced as a method for accessing deeper layers of simulated or quantum-encoded experience.
