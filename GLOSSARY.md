# Glossary of Key Terms: Vestigial Port Theory

This glossary defines the central terms, metaphors, and theoretical constructs used throughout the Vestigial Port Model (VPM) and the Dimensional Memory Protocol (DMP).

---

### 🧠 Vestigial Port Model (VPM)
A hypothesis that the pineal gland serves as a biological interface — a "vestigial port" — for receiving non-local consciousness signals originating from base reality.

---

### 🌀 Base Reality
The theorized foundational layer of existence, beneath or beyond all simulations, where consciousness originates and all recursive simulations are anchored.

---

### 🔁 Recursive Simulation
A nested model of realities where each "world" is itself a simulation or echo of a deeper layer. Consciousness may traverse or perceive multiple layers.

---

### 🧬 Pineal Interface
The biological structure (pineal gland) proposed to act as a transducer or port, tuning the brain into external or non-local sources of conscious experience.

---

### 💡 Dimensional Memory Protocol (DMP)
A state or set of practices that align brain states (via DMT, entrainment, meditation, etc.) to access dimensional memory fields or data from other layers of consciousness.

---

### 🔊 Entrainment
The synchronization of brainwave frequencies with external stimuli (light, sound, vibration) to induce altered states of consciousness.

---

### 📡 Signal Field
The metaphysical or informational substrate from which non-local consciousness is sourced — imagined as a signal that can be "tuned" into through the pineal interface.

---

### 👁️ Watchers / Guides / System Administrators
Terms used to describe intelligences encountered during DMP states. These may represent simulations' structural overseers, archetypal projections, or extradimensional entities.

---

### 🔣 Recursive Origin Memory Access Tree
A symbolic metaphor (and visual) for layered memory and identity branching from a single source. Each node is a simulation layer; the root is base reality.

---

### 🧘 Psychedelic Threshold States
Experiences induced by substances like DMT, which may allow the brain to temporarily access higher-order perceptual layers or dimensional structures.

---

### 📖 Simulation-Strata Ontology
A philosophical framework for categorizing types of perceived reality based on their proximity to base reality or origin consciousness.
